            <h2>What is Privacy-as-a-Service?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a concept wherein privacy itself becomes a commodity, something you can purchase or rent in order to have your data secured and protected.</li>
                <li>This concept is one that was established in the book Neuromancer, a 1984 novel.</li>
                <li>In the novel, PaaS is depicted as a Privacy Screen, an expensive service (paid for by the second); as long as the user keeps paying by the second, the screen keeps their data secure via scrambling it so that the outside world can’t interpret it.</li>
                <li>While a relatively new concept, PaaS is already beginning to come to fruition in the real world.</li>
                <li>Examples of PaaS in our world include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>VPNs</li>
                    <li>Secure Email Apps</li>
                    <li>Privacy Suites and Apps  (manage accounts and data permissions)</li>
                    <li>Password Managers</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Data privacy achieved through advanced ANN (Artificial Neural Network) cryptography.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Impacts on Society and Culture</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Positive:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gives people power and control over their data</li>
                    <li>Gives people more comfort and peace of mind when it comes to their security</li>
                    <li>Prevents outer entities (i.e. companies, government, hackers) from violating user privacy via data breaches and harvesting)</li>
                    <li>Makes privacy handling easier and more convenient</li>
                    <li>Enforces rights to privacy</li>
                    <li>Protects against people using your own data against you</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Negative:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Makes privacy a commodity as opposed to a human right; you have to pay to enforce your rights</li>
                    <li>Services can be expensive, which means once PaaS becomes mainstream, it will be ideal for the rich but not the poor.</li>

            <h2>Impacts on Local and World Economy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Positive:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Demand for companies that specialize in data security is growing, with hundreds of startups emerging in recent years with such intent, bringing in more revenue on a global scale.</li>
                    <li>The appearance of more companies leads to a dramatic increase in job creation</li>
                    <li>Money generated by privacy subscription services will funnel back into families, communities and public infrastructure and communications.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Negative:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Privacy services are often expensive; for example, VPNs cost as much as 20 dollars per month. That’s a considerable amount of money taken from people’s pockets annually</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>In order to accommodate the sprawling amount of privacy startups, habitats have to be destroyed to make room for headquarters for said startups.</li>
